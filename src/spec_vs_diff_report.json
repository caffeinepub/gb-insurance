  "summary": "REQ-1 (removing the “Open shareable preview image” option from the admin dashboard UI) is not evidenced as implemented in the provided diff summary. The changes shown relate to the public Hero component/banner image and documentation/state summary files, which are not requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the admin-dashboard UI option/action labeled “Open shareable preview image” so it is not shown anywhere within the admin dashboard experience (Dashboard page and any dashboard-related components/menus/actions).",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows edits to the admin dashboard page or dashboard-related components/menus/actions that would remove a control labeled “Open shareable preview image”, nor any removal of logic that opens the shareable preview image from the dashboard.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (lists Dashboard-related files but shows no actual code changes removing the option)",

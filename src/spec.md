# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Open shareable preview image” option from the admin dashboard UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the dashboard UI control (button/link/menu item/action) labeled “Open shareable preview image” from the admin dashboard page and any dashboard-related components/menus/actions that expose it.
- Ensure no admin dashboard interaction opens the shareable preview image in a new tab/window.

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users no longer see or can use any “Open shareable preview image” option within the dashboard, while non-dashboard pages remain unchanged.
